## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep, desaturated blue (#4A6572), reminiscent of deep river waters, conveying a sense of sorrow and solemnity.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F4F7), to create a somber mood without being too dark or depressing.
- Accent color: Muted orange (#A77B53), analogous to blue, like the memory of the warm life the fish once lived.
- Font pairing: 'Literata' (serif) for headings to convey a sense of historical record, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text to provide readability.
- Use somber, minimalist icons. Favor line icons over filled ones. Icons should primarily be functional to improve UX (e.g. indicate links).
- Employ a clean, spacious layout with generous margins to create a sense of calm and reflection. Use a grid-based system to maintain consistency.
